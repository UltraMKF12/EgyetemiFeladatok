I needed an agency to help me build my startup and learned about Webgurus through a recommendation.

From our very first meeting, I knew they were the right choice. Their ability to understand the project goals and vision so quickly was truly impressive.

We've already hit a few milestones together. Their problem-solving skills, work quality, ethics, and support are exceptional. I am excited to have them as partners for the future.

Highly recommend them!





We were starting a non-profit and needed a website that should meet the following criteria: • Have a design that is warm and welcoming to our community of people living with obesity who are often stigmatized • Be user friendly - easy to make edits • Uploads quickly • Payments can be easily processed and reliable.

The Obesity Matters site developed and managed by Web Gurus checks off all of the above.  Marton is a pleasure to work with. He is personable, knowledgeable and gets the work done.





Excellent team! Márton supported me throughout the entire build process. He made himself available to discuss feedback and next steps. A real collaborator and I appreciated it!

WebGurus is the way to go and definitely look to collaborate with Márton and his team in the future!
